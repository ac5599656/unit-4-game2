## Summary
The Crystal Game app allows user to click each crystal picture to increase the number to the app number.

## More Description
The problem with the app was getting four different crystal picture to show.  To resolve the problem,
I created an array of images and use for each loop to reassign a new number to the crystal image when the user 
is done each time increasing the number to the app number.
